These paintings, meticulous in detailing and delicate in brushwork, are done on cloth, marble, wood or paper. Meenakari, beautifully crafted enamel work is also indigenous to Udaipur. The Meenakari filigree animals and birds are richly coloured in enamel work of ruby reds, blues, greens and whites. </p> <p><br></p> <p>Bandhini &amp; Lehariya, age old techniques of tying and dyeing fabrics, are another specialty of the region.
